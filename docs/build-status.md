## Done

- **Core engine — plan `docs/plans/2026-07-05-video-grid-core.md`, Tasks 0–11 ALL
  COMPLETE**, final review verdict READY (2026-07-07). 49 tests green (incl.
  golden fixture: real MVI_3739 footage @59.94fps through the full engine).
  Notable amendments beyond plan-verbatim code:
  - vidstab preflight = warning, not blocker (`07d2e68`) — homebrew-core ffmpeg
    lacks libvidstab; core never calls it; process-episode re-checks hard.
  - lib hardening (`341d059`): smooth([])→[], savgol odd-window ordering, on_line
    raises on route/path desync, gain(≤0) raises with remedy.
  - **route-gap desync fix (`a19937f`)**: crop x(t) built from route timestamps,
    not frame index — occlusion gaps no longer desync crop from video timeline;
    empty route fails loud.
  - Golden fixture as-built: window 9.083–10.668s (not lena_ride2) — diagonal
    motion means no 2.5s window in MVI_3739 classifies lateral; see plan Task 9.5.
  - **Hardening round (2026-07-07, fresh-eyes audit, 5 commits `27e3571`→`0c8c283`):**
    proc.run surfaces ffmpeg stderr; check_episode validates composition
    (+`break`=editorial-only) and uses spec-§9 boundary-luma black check; track
    drops id=None frankentracks, probes fps/dims, adds speed+border features;
    reframe caps expr knots (~80), even dims for all canvases, §6.4 Y headroom,
    loud stabilize/fps guards; storyboard hero-marks helper. **68 tests green.**
    Spec/plan/landmines synced same round.

- **process-episode orchestrator DONE (2026-07-08)** — plan
  `docs/plans/2026-07-08-process-episode-orchestrator.md`, Tasks 0–7 via strict
  subagent-driven-development. **122 tests green.** Built: `scripts/lib/manifest.py`
  (validate gate), `scripts/lib/orchestration.py` (contradiction detect +
  retry-ladder + escalation), `scripts/lib/proc.py`, `scripts/process_episode.py`
  (deterministic loop: track→reframe→storyboard→check, threads probed
  canvas/src_dims — **closes the contract note** — times stages, hero marks on
  storyboard), `SKILLS/process-episode/SKILL.md` (subagent: ask-before-start,
  editorial gate, stop-and-report). Golden fixture runs the whole orchestrator
  through real ffmpeg. Review-driven fixes: manifest null/unknown-key/model/color/
  canvas hardening, hero truthiness, centered→on_line alias, project_dir mkdir,
  hero-marks wiring. **Final whole-slice review (`5da32b2`):** verdict READY after
  one Important fix — a named/rule hero (non-tuple) silently suppressed the §6.1a
  hero-ambiguity stop-and-report while never being seeded; introduced
  `orch.is_seed_pin` (non-empty tuple), the single predicate shared by the
  ambiguity gate and the shell's `seed_bbox` gate. **124 tests green.**

- **engine dataclass-hardening DONE (2026-07-09)** — plan
  `docs/plans/2026-07-08-engine-dataclass-hardening.md` + design
  `docs/specs/2026-07-08-engine-dataclass-hardening-design.md`, Tasks 0–10 via
  strict subagent-driven-development (branch `feat/engine-hardening`, commits
  `78e0fb9`..`4509cd6`). **168 tests green incl. 3 real-ffmpeg integration tests
  (2 on the golden ride).** Built `scripts/lib/models.py` — typed wire-contracts
  (`RoutePoint`/`TrackMeta`/`CropPath`/`CheckResult`/`Report`, JSON
  schema-compatible round-trip) + config-specs (`TrackSpec`/`ReframeSpec`/
  `CheckSpec`/`StoryboardSpec`/`Delivery`) that raise on bad construction. Every
  engine script retyped onto specs; `check_episode.run` returns a `Report`,
  `track.build_route`/`reframe.reframe`/`storyboard.build` take specs.
  **Validation principle:** manifest gate stays SOFT (`validate()`→`needs_input`);
  everything below it is HARD (raises). **Fixes:** #1 hero `intent` derived from
  composition/motion (was always "action" → wrong hero on static/center); #2
  lead-over-nonlateral → `stop_and_report` before wasting reframes; #3
  `black_frames` relative gate (near-black AND < 0.35×body-median — dark footage
  no longer false-fails); #4 hero marks at frame-SAMPLE times (was route-index,
  desynced on gaps); #5 Douglas-Peucker iterative (no RecursionError on long
  routes); #F engine resolution/aspect-agnostic — `Delivery` (native/short_edge/
  long_edge/exact), no 9:16/1080×1920 hardcode; #G `color_means` positivity.
  Review-driven fixes: `CheckResult.to_dict` strips stale pass-key; `Delivery`
  guards non-positive crop + clean `from_spec` errors; specs raise `ValueError`
  (not `TypeError`) on wrong-type; `check_episode` body-luma sampling spread
  across clip (was first ~1s → `body_median`=0 defeated the gate). **Known
  limitation:** the storyboard hero-marker's vertical fraction uses `y/src_h`
  (exact only when `crop_h==src_h`, i.e. 9:16-from-landscape); horizontal `fx` is
  always correct — a follow-up can thread `crop_h`/`cy` for landscape/square.

- **project-init DONE (2026-07-09)** — plan `docs/plans/2026-07-09-project-init.md`
  + design `docs/specs/2026-07-09-project-init-design.md`, Tasks 0–4 via strict
  subagent-driven-development (branch `feat/project-init`, commits
  `af3753a`..`54dfa35`). **188 tests green incl. a real-ffmpeg native-inheritance
  golden.** The front-door that drives the aspect/resolution-agnostic engine:
  `scripts/lib/project.py` — `ProjectConfig` (raises on bad),
  `PURPOSE_CANVAS`/`QUALITY_DELIVERY` maps (**delivery defaults to `native`** — no
  silent downscale; a 1080 cap is a deliberate social opt-in), `resolve_project`,
  and `resolve_manifest` (episode inherits absent canvas/delivery, explicit
  episode value overrides, null=inherit, no mutation). `scripts/process_episode.py`
  gains `project=` (a `ProjectConfig` or a `project.json` path) applied before
  validation. `scripts/project_init.py` CLI writes `project.json`;
  `SKILLS/project-init/SKILL.md` is the one-time "what's this video for" pass.
  Review-driven: override integration test made load-bearing (21:9),
  `ProjectConfig.from_json` corrupt→ValueError-with-remedy, SKILL description fixed
  ('custom' quality is an explicit `--delivery`). **Reconciliation note:**
  `project.json` is the machine `{canvas, delivery}` subset; the fuller `SPEC.md`
  reel-brief (music/mood/hook/cast) will later populate/supersede it — no conflict.
  cast.json/SPEC.md-brief/router/footage-intake stayed out of scope.

- **docs registry + coding standards (2026-07-09)** — specs moved to
  [`docs/specs/`](./spec/); anna-auth-style standards adopted
  ([coding-standards.md](./coding-standards.md), [testing-guide.md](./testing-guide.md),
  [development-workflow.md](./development-workflow.md)); `CLAUDE.md` became a
  registry; scripts brought into compliance (full type hints, imports-at-top).

## Next action

- **cast.json ingestion** (montage design §6.1a / §-line 287): hero registry — one
  interactive naming pass from surfaced crops → name + seg-mask appearance
  descriptor; descriptor wiring into manifests; unlocks cast-name hero pins (today
  `orch.is_seed_pin` only accepts a bbox tuple). **OR**
- **reframe-extensions** — layouts fit-blur/insert/split/pan + vidstab +
  optical-flow degradation; removes the matching `validate()` refusals. **OR**
- **router** — cap-3 fan-out: resolve project → `resolve_manifest` per episode →
  fan out `process_episode`.

## Deferred / open

- vidstab-capable ffmpeg before stabilization (`bash setup.sh --with-vidstab`).
- descriptor continuity re-match needs ingestion's cast.json.
- cap-3 parallel fan-out is the router's job.

## External assets (outside this repo)

- **Golden fixture source (plan Task 9.5):** session footage + window map at
  `/Users/serg/Downloads/untitled folder/REEL_SOURCES.md` — footage (`MVI_*.MP4`,
  `DJI_*.MP4`, ~128 files) sits in that same folder. `MVI_3739.MP4` (the long
  ride) is the suggested fixture source.
- The Jul 3–5 montage session that this design was reverse-engineered from
  produced Reel A (ODESZA) and Reel B (Billie Eilish); real-footage validation
  happens when Sergei re-montages that footage — user-driven, not a milestone.
